      <p>
        Full stack web development involves working on both the front-end
        (user interface and experience) and the back-end (server, 
        database, and application logic) of a web application. My web development
        journey began in Januarary of 2025, when I first learned html and css, and built
        this website that you are on right now! Below is the progression of what I'm
        planning to learn by the end of the year! I hope to continue adding more and more
        projects to this section in the future.<br>
        1. html and css
        2. javascript
        3. SQL and Databases
        4. Frameworks like react.js and more
