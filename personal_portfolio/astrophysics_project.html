      <h1> Astrophysics Research </h1>
      <h2> Background: </h2>
      <p>
        In the summer of 2023, I had the privalige of researching near-earth 
        at the University of Colorado Boulder through the SSP program. There, I
        learned the ins and outs of dynamical systems, orbital mechanics, and computational
        modeling for scientific research. Beyond being an incredible learning experience,
        it was also a fun experience and opportunity to man research grade telescopes, 
        take photos of nebulas, and meeting new people.

                Asteroid Studied: 1998 RO4

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              Telescopic images from three observation sessions were used to 
              estimate the orbital elements and absolute H magnitude of near-Earth 
              asteroid 1998 RO4. The method of Gauss and a Monte Carlo simulation 
              were used to determine that 1998 RO4 has a semi-major axis of 
              2.130±0.009 AU, an eccentricity of 0.423±0.002, an inclination of 
              5.36±0.01°, a longitude of the ascending node of 191.77±0.08°, an 
              argument of periapsis of 111.95±0.10°, and a mean anomaly on 2023 
              June 27 6:26:2.155 of 352.09±0.06°. Linear regression was used to 
              ascertain that 1998 RO4 has an absolute H magnitude of 18.6. The 
              Rebound simulation using these orbital elements showed that over 50 
              million years, 25.00% remained in orbit, 13.33% crashed into the sun, 
              and 61.67% were ejected from the solar system, showing that it is 
              improbable that 1998 RO4 will collide with Earth within this timeframe.
