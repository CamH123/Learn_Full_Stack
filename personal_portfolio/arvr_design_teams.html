      <h2> Background: </h2>
      <p>
        The NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) challenge invites 
        student teams to design and develop augmented reality (AR) interfaces for astronauts. 
        These interfaces are aimed at assisting astronauts during spacewalks by providing real-time
         information, guidance, and navigation tools. Our team is working on creating an intuitive 
         AR system that integrates mission-critical data, such as environmental readings, task 
         instructions, and hazard alerts, to enhance astronaut safety and efficiency. By leveraging
          cutting-edge technologies like AR headsets and software development, we aim to deliver a
           solution that aligns with NASA's vision for future space exploration.

            <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>
                We developed an AR interface in Unity to support regolith sampling, 
                ingress/egress procedures, and rover communication, leveraging Unity's AR 
                Foundation and C# scripting for functionality. For regolith sampling, we 
                implemented spatially anchored visual markers, real-time procedural guidance, 
                and tool-specific instructions to ensure precision during collection tasks. In 
                the ingress/egress workflow, the interface provides a structured step-by-step 
                guide, augmented with interactive safety checklists and visual indicators for 
                equipment verification. To facilitate rover communication, we integrated a 
                telemetry dashboard displaying rover status, sensor data, and navigation commands,
                 enabling seamless collaboration between the astronaut and rover. The system 
                 employs efficient data synchronization, state management, and 3D object rendering
                  to deliver a comprehensive and intuitive AR solution for critical mission 
                  operations.
