      <h2> Background: </h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, AI has become more popular than ever, finding its way into almost
        every industry and aspect of daily life. To gain a better understanding of the 
        theoretical backing behind this field of computer science, I self studied UC Berkley's
        CS182 course in deep learning. Using this knowledge, the projects below represent my 
        own implementations of various machine learning models, nueral networks, and their applications
        with real world data to solve pressing issues.

        <h2>Softmax Regression Implementation and Application with Iris Flower Classification</h2>

          <div class = "project-info">
            <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>
              Implemented a softmax function, negative log likelihood loss function, and a 
              gradient descent algorithm based off lecture 2 notes from CS182.


            </p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              Predicted training data with 97% accuracy. <br>
              Predicted testing data with 100% accuracy.
            </p>
            <h3>Improvements:</h3>
            <p>
              Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve performance
