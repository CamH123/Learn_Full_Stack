      <h2> Background: </h2>
      <p>
        Sponsored by the Unmanned Exploration Laboratory, we are developing a 
        cutting-edge machine learning algorithm and sample collection device to 
        enable our rovers to autonomously navigate and analyze the lunar surface,
         specifically searching for water in lunar lava tubes. This project 
         leverages advanced skills in computer science, electronics, and 
         mechanical engineering to contribute to lunar habitation initiatives.

            <p>
                Using ROS 2 and Python, we developed the movement, sensing, and 
                navigation capabilities of the lunar rover. ROS 2 provided a modular
                 framework to integrate various components, such as motor controllers, 
                 sensors, and cameras, allowing seamless communication between them. 
                 Python scripts were used to implement algorithms for tasks like 
                 obstacle avoidance, environment mapping, and path planning, enabling 
                 the rover to autonomously explore and navigate the lunar surface with
                precision.
