      <h2> Background: </h2>
      <p>
        Data science is the study of using data to find patterns, gain insights, and solve 
        problems. It combines math, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to analyze data 
        and make better decisions. My journey with data science started in the summer of 2024
        during my internship at Abbvie where I wrote programs to analyze and visualize infusion pumping performance 
        to improve flowrate percision. To continue learning data science, I'm eager to explore how AI/ML can be used 
        to find more percise insights as well as new data cleaning techniques and visualization strategies.

            <h3>Background:</h3>
            <p>
              Thyroid disease refers to conditions that affect the thyroid gland, leading to 
              issues with hormone production that can impact metabolism, energy, and overall 
              health. Data science can help by analyzing medical data to improve diagnosis, 
              predict disease progression, and personalize treatment plans.
